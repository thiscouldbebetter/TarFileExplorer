TAR File Explorer
=================

An HTML/TypeScript/JavaScript application that allows the user to upload a TAR file, view, add, download, or remove the files contained within it, and then download the modified archive.

To build, make sure that "tsc" is installed, then open the Source directory in a command prompt window and run the command "tsc".  Note, however that the compiled .js files are included in the repository, so it shouldn't be necessary to build the program before running it.

To run, open the file Source/TarExplorer.html in a web browser that runs JavaScript.
